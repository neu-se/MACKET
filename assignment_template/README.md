# Racket Assignment Template
Contains some scripts to generate an empty Racket assignment in which students have to implement test cases using `check-expect`.
To get started, run `bash init_project.sh {hw_name}`, replacing {hw_name} with the name of the assignment, e.g., "hw3". Then follow the instructions printed by that script.
